## Content Guidelines

### Documentation Standards

#### Writing Style
- **Clear and concise**: Use simple, direct language
- **Professional tone**: Maintain a professional but approachable voice
- **Consistent terminology**: Use consistent terms throughout
- **Active voice**: Prefer active voice over passive voice

#### Content Structure
- **Logical flow**: Organize content in a logical sequence
- **Progressive disclosure**: Start simple, then add complexity

### Markdown Guidelines

#### Basic Formatting
```markdown
# Main heading (H1)
## Section heading (H2)
### Subsection heading (H3)

**Bold text** for emphasis
*Italic text* for terms
`inline code` for code snippets

> Blockquotes for important notes

- Bullet points for lists
- Use consistent indentation

1. Numbered lists for steps
2. Maintain proper numbering
```

#### Code Blocks
```markdown
# Python example
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
print(data.head())
```

# Bash example
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

# Run script
python train_model.py
```

# YAML example
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```
```

#### Admonitions

:::

:::warning

:::

:::danger

```

### File Naming Conventions

- **Use kebab-case**: `getting-started.md`, `model-deployment.md`
- **Descriptive names**: Choose names that clearly indicate content
- **Consistent extensions**: Use `.md` for all documentation files
- **Avoid spaces**: Use hyphens instead of spaces in filenames

### Front Matter

Every documentation file should include front matter:

```markdown
---
sidebar_position: 1
title: Page Title
description: Brief description of the page content
---

# Page Title

Content starts here...
```
