# AI Concepts Overview

This section provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), laying the groundwork for understanding modern AI workflows and tools.

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence is the field of computer science dedicated to creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include:

- **Problem Solving**: Finding solutions to complex problems
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying patterns in data
- **Learning**: Improving performance through experience
- **Reasoning**: Making logical deductions and decisions
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding and generating human language
- **Computer Vision**: Interpreting visual information

## Types of AI

### Narrow AI (Weak AI)
Narrow AI is designed to perform specific tasks and is the most common form of AI today:

```python
# Example: Image classification
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50

model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')
# This model can classify images but cannot perform other tasks
```

### General AI (Strong AI)
General AI would have human-like cognitive abilities across all domains. This remains theoretical and is not yet achieved.

### Artificial Superintelligence
A hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects.

## Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms that can learn and make predictions from data.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Data
The foundation of any ML system:

```python
# Structured data example
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'feature2': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
    'target': [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
})
```

#### 2. Features
Characteristics or attributes used to make predictions:

- **Numerical**: Age, temperature, price
- **Categorical**: Color, country, category
- **Text**: Reviews, descriptions
- **Images**: Pixels, shapes, objects

#### 3. Labels/Targets
The values we want to predict:

```python
# Binary classification
labels = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]  # 0 = negative, 1 = positive

# Multi-class classification
labels = ['cat', 'dog', 'bird', 'cat', 'dog']

# Regression
labels = [25.5, 30.2, 18.7, 22.1, 28.9]  # Continuous values
```

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
Learning from labeled data to make predictions on new, unseen data.

#### Classification
Predicting discrete categories:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Training data
X_train = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]]
y_train = [0, 0, 1, 1]

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make prediction
prediction = model.predict([[2.5, 3.5]])
```

#### Regression
Predicting continuous values:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Training data
X_train = [[1], [2], [3], [4]]
y_train = [2, 4, 6, 8]

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make prediction
prediction = model.predict([[5]])
```

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Finding patterns in data without predefined labels.

#### Clustering
Grouping similar data points:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Data without labels
X = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [8, 9], [9, 10]]

# Perform clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(X)
```

#### Dimensionality Reduction
Reducing the number of features while preserving important information:

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Reduce 4D data to 2D
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X)
```

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Learning through interaction with an environment to maximize rewards.

```python
# Simplified Q-learning example
import numpy as np

class QLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self, states, actions, learning_rate=0.1, discount_factor=0.9):
        self.q_table = np.zeros((states, actions))
        self.lr = learning_rate
        self.gamma = discount_factor
    
    def update(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        old_value = self.q_table[state, action]
        next_max = np.max(self.q_table[next_state])
        new_value = (1 - self.lr) * old_value + self.lr * (reward + self.gamma * next_max)
        self.q_table[state, action] = new_value
```

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns.

### Neural Networks
Inspired by biological neurons:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Simple neural network
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Specialized for image processing:

```python
# CNN for image classification
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Designed for sequential data:

```python
# LSTM for text processing
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(10000, 128),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(32),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

## Model Evaluation

### Metrics for Classification

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

# Calculate metrics
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')
recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')
f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')
```

### Metrics for Regression

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, r2_score

# Calculate metrics
mse = mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_true, y_pred)
```

## Bias and Fairness

AI systems can inherit biases from training data or design decisions:

### Types of Bias
- **Data Bias**: Underrepresented groups in training data
- **Algorithmic Bias**: Biases introduced by the learning algorithm
- **Societal Bias**: Prejudices present in society reflected in AI systems

### Mitigation Strategies
- Diverse training data
- Fairness-aware algorithms
- Regular bias audits
- Transparent model documentation
